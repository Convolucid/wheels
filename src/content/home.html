    This site was designed as an iterative rehearsal space.  I created it as a barebones page with the intent of deleting it and rebuilding from scratch, over and over ad nauseum.  Each version is modified and improved slightly to a comfortable stopping point, then a new branch is created to delete the whole thing and start over.  I rewrite the code every time (using the old code as reference if necessary).
