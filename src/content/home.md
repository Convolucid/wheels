**Training Wheels** is an iterative project I built to practice front-end design.  Each version of the site is written from a clean slate: before new features are implemented, I erase the current code base and rebuild from nothing.  Developing the entire project each time has been a rewarding strategy (though tedious at times).  Drilling fundamentals is worth its weight in experience.

This is just the fourth version of the site, so it remains simple, streamlined, and mostly featureless.  Still, if you'd like to see how the project has changed, click the "History" link above.  If you wish to see a detailed breakdown of my site-building procedure, click "Process".
