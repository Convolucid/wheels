# welcome to my rehearsal space

**Training Wheels** is an iterative project I built to practice front-end design.  Like a martial artist training techniques into muscle memory, I write and delete and rewrite this code, over and over ad nauseum.  New features are added only after I erase my work and rebuild.

This is only the second version of the site, so it remains simple, streamlined, and mostly featureless.  Still, if you'd like to see how the project has changed, click the "History" link above.  If you wish to see a detailed breakdown of my site-building procedure, click "Process".
