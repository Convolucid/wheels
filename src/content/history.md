# version 0.2
I changed the content files to Markdown instead of HTML.  The `markdown-loader` for Webpack converts them anyway, and it's much easier to type content in .md than HTML.  I cleaned up the README.md file as well to better reflect the "delete and start over" process.

The biggest change in this version is my approach to styling.  I must have watched and read hours of CSS tutorials to cobble together a better process, especially the tutorials on [Kevin Powell's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob).  Starting my stylesheet with custom CSS properties for overall site-design, integrating a CSS reset for cross-browser compatibility, and developing really clear responsive and mobile-first principles has been a priority.

# version 0.1
The initial version of this page is just a three-section layout with some icons at the bottom.  The first section, Home, describes the basic intent of the page.  This is the second section, History, which will detail the progress from iteration to iteration.  The third section, Process, records the steps I take to create the site from the ground up each time.  It's basically a tutorial I made for myself to practice the same coding 'song' over and over.

There are currently only four icons for the primary tools I'm using: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Webpack - not counting Git, Vercel, VSCode, and Illustrator, which I'll likely include next.  Additional icons for Markdown, Blender, other Adobe Suite programs, Three.js, React, et cetera will be added in future versions of the site.
